# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is based on the following tutorial: [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#before-we-start-the-tutorial).

A tic-tac-toe game that:

* Lets you play tic-tac-toe
* Indicates when a player has won the game or when the game ends in a draw
* Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
* Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
